How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a very interesting experience. My pair and I both made our own frames and then compared and disucssed the benefits and oversights of each. We both made fairly simple wireframes so it was a quick and easy discussion. Same with the HTML because we were making simple skeleton pages without style and without much information yet.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
It was helpful to the process. Starting to develop and write the code for you page is  much easier, especially with the semantic tags, when you have a visual aid to help guide you. It makes it a much speedier process.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided having a dedicated navigation panel and a previous and next buttons helped in this wireframe. As well as marking of the areas with what type of information would be contained.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about quite a few semantic elements such as header, section, article, nav, and footer. You can see them implemented into my code below.
-->
  <HEAD>
    <title>Blog Post Name</title>
  </HEAD>

  <body>
    <section>
      <header><h1>Header</h1></header>
    <!-- This is the same header/navigation panel that will be used for the entire site. Copy that code here. -->
    </section>

    <section>
      <!-- This is the portion that will be shown on the individual blog post page -->
      <nav>
        <h2>Other Blog Post</h2>
        <a href=#Previous article>Article Title</a>
        <!-- This is the side navigation panel for other blogs -->
      </nav>

      <header>
        <h3>Blog Post Title</h3>
