      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello everyone! My name is Phillip Barnet, I'm 26,  live in Oakland, CA, and am recently married. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Environmental Economics and Policy, but last worked as a case manager and program coordinator for a mentoring and work readiness program for at risk youth. I had been looking for a career change and have always wanted to create apps and programs that I believe could benefit myself, others, and our society, so when an opportunity to attend DBC out here in San Francisco presented itself, I excitedly pursued it. I do photography and graphic design on the side, but DBC is my number one priority. I am most excited to learn the intricacies of coding, the different languages, and how it can be used to create very complex, but beneficial programs and applications. I look forward to getting to know all of you better over the next 9 weeks and eventually meeting you.</p>
