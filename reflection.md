###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned how and when to utilize each. Having the image with color coded outlines in Chrome DevTools really help to utilize padding, borders, and margin. Padding is best used in creating space around your content, especially within the border. The border is good for differentiating separate elements and even within an element. Margin was great for creating space between elements, as well as assisting with position around the page.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned that positioning is a bit more challenging than I previously thought. You have to find the right combination of location elements, with margin, with position, as well as width and height to find the one that works the most for you sit. You must also be aware that as you change one thing it may affect another and you must be prepared to adjust.

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The design of the elements and utilizing the css was the easiest part of this challenge. Understand how to use the various selectors and how to have them affect multiple parts of your page was an easy thing to pick-up. The positioning piece has and is still the most challenging part of this.

###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I really learned why it is better to utilize CSS to format and design your site. Not only is it very efficient, it allows you to affect many different pages of your website with the same code. I also learned that with so many different options there are probably more than one way to accomplish a goal. This is both reassuring and allows you to implement the process that works best for you.
